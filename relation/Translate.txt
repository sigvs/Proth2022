Experimental location studies
local optima in the solution space of the optimization problem
indicate that in many problems there is a high
concentration of local optima in the immediate
proximity to the global optimum~\cite{Reev}. This observation is known as
the thesis about the existence of a <<big valley>> for minimization problems
or <<central array>> for tasks to the maximum. Distance to global optimum
in our case, we will calculate in the metric $l_1$.

This thesis partly explains the performance of genetic
algorithms. If local optima are collected in the population and
the next solution is chosen somewhere between two arbitrary
local optima, then such a process has many chances to find
global optimum. In this regard, verification and theoretical
substantiation of this hypothesis is of undoubted interest.

In order to test this thesis, the paper proposes a method
finding the number of integer points in the intersection
ball of a given radius in the $l_1$ metric with a parallelepiped,
having faces parallel to the coordinate planes. The
the method was obtained by reducing the problem to a combinatorial one
formulation already considered earlier for the case of non-negative
integer points, using
generating functions~\cite{Sach}. In the present work, a generalization
the specified result to the conditions we need.


A series of experiments were carried out on existing tasks for
determination of the structure of local optima. With a one-time
running the local lifting algorithm LSA solution $H$ whose elements $h_i$ are chosen with
uniform distribution between 1 and $d_i$ improved to a local optimum.
This procedure was repeated 300 times to create the necessary
sample size~\cite{Bose}. Based on the results obtained, it was calculated
the number of admissible solutions $\mid \Omega \mid$ in balls containing all found
local optima. In this case, the distance from
best found local optimum to the worst, and beyond the center -
the best local optimum found.
